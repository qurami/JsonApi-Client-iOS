# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This resource is currently under development and not currently published, I will release publicly the first version of this pod when achieving a decent test coverage.  
In the meanwhile feel free to fork and hack!  

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

QuramiJsonApi is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "QuramiJsonApi"
```

## Acknowledgements

This library is a fork of another great iOS library by [Josh Holtz](https://github.com/joshdholtz/jsonapi-ios).  
Since the design ideas and the classes have changed from his original implementation, we've decided to publish it as a separate library that we maintain and update for our app [Qurami](http://qurami.com).   
We believe that what is Open Source remains Open Source, so here's our contribution.
